The function in this app are Login/Register, Add/Edit/Delete Categories, Add/Edit/Delete Transactions, Edit Profile.

The challenge is to make minimal design and deal with the data. I've search for many GUI and apply it to my project so thanks to [𝘙𝘑 𝘊𝘰𝘥𝘦 𝘈𝘥𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦](https://rjcodeadvance.com/category/punto-net/c-sharp/) and [𝘙𝘦𝘻𝘢 𝘈𝘨𝘩𝘢𝘦𝘪](https://github.com/r-aghaei/FlatNumericUpDownExample) for giving me some tutorial video how to make custom GUI.
